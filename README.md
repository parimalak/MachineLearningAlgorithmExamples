# MachineLearningAlgorithmExamples
Machine algorithms coding samples for different datasets

Machine-learning-Ex1 folder contains the application of Linear regression Programmed in matlab.
gmm.py file generates data using gaussian mixture model(gmm)
naiveBayesGaussian.py file demonstrates the application of naive bayes on numerical data genearted by gmm.
